Algorithm Selection: The model relies on LightGBM, a gradient boosting framework, known for its efficiency and effectiveness in handling large datasets and complex relationships.

Feature Engineering: Various features are engineered, including lagged prices, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and fear-greed index, to capture key market dynamics and enhance predictive accuracy.

Cross-Validation Strategy: GroupKFold cross-validation is employed, ensuring the model's robustness, particularly for time-series data, by preventing data leakage between folds and providing a reliable estimate of its performance.

Evaluation Metric: Mean absolute error (MAE) is used as the evaluation metric, quantifying the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values, thereby assessing the model's predictive accuracy in forecasting stock price returns over a 20-day period.

Feature Importance Analysis: The model conducts a feature importance analysis post-training, visualizing the relative importance of each feature using a bar plot, aiding in identifying the most influential factors driving the stock price predictions.

Integration of External Data: External data, such as the fear-greed index, is integrated into the model to capture additional market sentiment and external factors that may impact stock prices, enhancing its predictive capabilities.
